What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	An empty Git repository has been initialized in a .git directory located in the directory
	where I initialized the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It is a transitory area where you prepare your files to be saved via commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	First, by git add <file>, add the modified files in the staging area.
	Then, by git diff --staged, check the differences between the staging area and the last commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Branches would be helpful if different experimentations are required on a project from a same starting point. It allows deveopers to go in different directions.
