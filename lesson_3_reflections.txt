When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository can be useful if I want to access this repository from multiple devices, share with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I always want to have control on what I share on my remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of a repository directly on Github.
    A clone is a copy of a repository to a computer.
    A branch is a set of related commits where one commit is always a parent for the next one (excluding the most current one).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
