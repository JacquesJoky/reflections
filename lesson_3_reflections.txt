When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    A remote repository can be useful if I want to access this repository from multiple devices, share with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I always want to have control on what I share on my remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of a repository directly on Github.
    A clone is a copy of a repository to a computer.
    A branch is a set of related commits where one commit is always a parent for the next one (excluding the most current one).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    By keeping a copy of the last known state of the remote
	stored locally, you can easily branch off your work commited locally from the work that may be fetched from the remote later.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would use Google Drive and Google Docs to share and collaborate on my files. It would be easier since files are automatically saved. But it would be harder to keep track of project milestones.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When you collaborate on a project, it would make more sense to ake changes in a separate branch. By that way, one can submit changes for review before merging them into master. There is more work
